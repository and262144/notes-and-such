‘aetiology’
(the study of causation) and teleology (the study of the
purpose of a given phenomenon, rather than its cause)

 ‘No experience is in itself a
cause of our success or failure. We do not suffer from the
shock of our experiences—the so-called trauma—but instead
we make out of them whatever suits our purposes. We are not
determined by our experiences, but the meaning we give them
is self-determining.’
