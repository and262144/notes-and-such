## Respiratory Organs

- $\ce{O2}$ is used to indirectly break down simple molecules.
- $\ce{CO2}$ is removed.
- This cycle is continued till life and is called breathing, commonly known as respiration(idiotic wording here NCERT not cool).

Mechanism of Breathing vary among organisms and can be put into categories based on their complexity of body organisation and habitat, loosely being:-

**Lower Invertebrates:** (Eg:- Sponges , coelenterates , flatworms etc) [Simple Diffusion]{.highlight}.

**Earthworm** ⟶ [Moist cuticle]{.highlight}

**Most Insects:** ⟶ [Network of Tracheal Tubes]{.highlight}

**Aquatic Animals:**(arthropods,Molluscs,fishes) ⟶ [Gills]{.highlight}

**Vertebrates:** ⟶ [Lungs]{.highlight}

[Frogs can respire through their moist skin also]{.note}
