## What is AI?
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science aimed at creating systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include decision-making, language understanding, pattern recognition, problem-solving, and more. At its core, AI involves the creation of algorithms that can learn from data, adapt over time, and make predictions or classifications. Modern AI has evolved to include subfields such as machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics.
