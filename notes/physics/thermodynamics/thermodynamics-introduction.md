## Macro-states and Micro-states 

**Macro-states:** State of a system as a whole , which can be described by a few macroscopic variables like temperature, volume, pressure, etc.

**Micro-states:** State of every individual atom/particle of system , which can be described by their position, velocity, momentum, etc.

:::{.note}
Thermodynamics is concerned with macro-states and processes which bring a change in such states , despite the fact that such changes are direct consequence of the change in microstates , it is illogical to measure all of these changes , rather the sum total of the changes , i.e. the change is macro-state is considered.

## When work is done :
on or by a system;
- there is a change in the 
  - physical
  - chemical
state of the system.
- This change causes various aspects about the macroscopic properties to change 
- Our goal is to calculate such changes and categorize them 
- why they occur 
- their results on the system
- and then make predictions on what will happen if we change the conditions of a system
- and finally use that knowledge to understand physical and chemical processes and solve problems and get good marks and stuff

One such tool we use  for this is the Ideal Gas Law , or derivatives of it :- 
$$\rho V= n_aRT$$

where:
- $\rho$ is the density of the gas
- $V$ is the Volume of the gas
- $n_a$ is the number of moles of the gas
- $R$ is the Universal Gas Constant , i.e. 
- $T$ is the temperature

(never learnt this )

- We can observe the relationship between the said variables which affect the macro-state of a system . When at a point of no change is called equilibrium . 
- Such an equilibrium is stable if the system is in a state of minimum energy .
- Equilibrium is disrupted when there is a change in the macroscopic variables of the system , which is called a process .
- This can be represented by a $P-V$ aka pressure volume graph.

:::{.note}
Macro variables are defined only at equilibrium , hence may be easily plotted on a $P-V$ graph . When not in such a state a graph may or may not be plotted depending on some other factors
:::

**Quasi-static Process:** A process in which the system is always almost in a state of equilibrium . This is a very idealized process and is never actually observed in nature .

- Gives us an idea of the change in macroscopic variables of the system and makes graphing the process possible.

>> We are going to study quasi-static processes as they make understandable graphs for exams , and definitely not to be scientific

- Infinitely Close to eq
- Can observe previous state of the system 
- And can therefore be reversible(not always)

Time for the infamous laws of Thermodynamics which make you sound cooler than you really are ; or maybe hotter , it's all relative, iykwim :)
