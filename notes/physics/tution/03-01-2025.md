[Monochromatic absorptance]{.tag}(aka spectral absorptance power)[$a_λ$]

Monochromatic emittance of a body corresponding to a particular wavelength λ is defined as the ratio of amount of heat energy incident upon it in the same time both in the unit wavelength interval around the wavelength λ , i.e. $(λ-1/2)→(λ+1/2)$.

### Black body

If the body neither reflects nor transmits the incident heat radiation , i.e. $r=0,t=0,a=1$ ,the body will absorb the entire heat radiation that s incident on it and appears black ; known as perfect black body .

## Kirchoff's Law 

According to Kirchoff's law ,, the ratio of emissive power to the absorptive power corresponding to a particular wavelength and at any given temperature is always constant for all bodies ; and this constant is equal to the emissive power of a perfect black body at the same temperature & corresponding to the same wavelength. 

$$ \frac{e_λ}{a_λ}=\text{const}=\frac{E_λ}{1}=E_λ$$
