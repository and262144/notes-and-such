# Radiation 

The Thermal Radiation are those , which produce in us the sensation of warmth . They are emitted by a body on account of it's temperature. Every body whose temperature is above 0 K emits thermal radiation . The radiation emitted depends upon 2 factors :- 

1. The temperature of the body 
2. The nature of the radiating surface of the body 

The wavelength of thermal radiations ranges from $700 \mu m$ to $1 mm$ ; they belong to the infra-red regions , $âˆ´$ thermal radiations are also called infrared radiation .

## Basic Characteristics of Thermal Radiations
(same as emv)

1. They travel with speed or light along straight line .
2. They require no medium for their propagation , so they can travel through vacumn. 
3. They do not hit the intertwining medium through which they travel
4. They obey the inverse square law.

5. They can be reflected and refracted according to laws of reflection and refraction of light.

6. Inhibit the phenomenon of interference , diffraction and polarization.
