<h2 id="what-is-ai">What is AI?</h2>
<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science aimed at
creating systems capable of performing tasks that typically require
human intelligence. These tasks include decision-making, language
understanding, pattern recognition, problem-solving, and more. At its
core, AI involves the creation of algorithms that can learn from data,
adapt over time, and make predictions or classifications. Modern AI has
evolved to include subfields such as machine learning, natural language
processing, computer vision, and robotics.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="uses-of-ai">Uses of AI</h2>
<p>AI is applied across diverse fields due to its adaptability and
potential for automation and efficiency. Some notable applications
include:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Healthcare</strong>: AI is used for diagnostics,
personalized medicine, and predictive analytics (e.g., predicting
disease outbreaks).</li>
<li><strong>Finance</strong>: Fraud detection, algorithmic trading, and
credit scoring leverage AI’s predictive power.</li>
