                  <h2 id="what-is-ai">What is AI?</h2>
<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science aimed at
creating systems capable of performing tasks that typically require
human intelligence. These tasks include decision-making, language
understanding, pattern recognition, problem-solving, and more. At its
core, AI involves the creation of algorithms that can learn from data,
adapt over time, and make predictions or classifications. Modern AI has
evolved to include subfields such as machine learning, natural language
processing, computer vision, and robotics.</p>

<h2 id="uses-of-ai">Uses of AI</h2>
<p>AI is applied across diverse fields due to its adaptability and
potential for automation and efficiency. Some notable applications
include:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Healthcare</strong>: AI is used for diagnostics,
personalized medicine, and predictive analytics (e.g., predicting
disease outbreaks).</li>
<li><strong>Finance</strong>: Fraud detection, algorithmic trading, and
credit scoring leverage AI’s predictive power.</li>
<li><strong>Transportation</strong>: Self-driving cars and route
optimization use AI to make real-time decisions.</li>

<h2 id="history-of-ai">History of AI</h2>
<p>The history of AI dates back to the mid-20th century with the
pioneering work of scientists like Alan Turing, who explored the
theoretical foundations of computation. Key milestones include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>1956</strong>: The Dartmouth Conference marked the formal
founding of AI as a field.</li>
<li><strong>1970s-1980s</strong>: AI research saw "AI winters" with
reduced funding due to unmet expectations.</li>
<li><strong>1990s-2000s</strong>: Revitalized by advances in
computational power and data availability, AI flourished with
innovations in machine learning and statistical approaches.</li>
<li><strong>2010s-present</strong>: AI has achieved breakthroughs in
deep learning and neural networks, demonstrated by achievements such as
AlphaGo and GPT models【31†source】【38†source】.</li>
