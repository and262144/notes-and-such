        <h2 id="what-is-ai">What is AI?</h2>
        <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science
        aimed at creating systems capable of performing tasks that
        typically require human intelligence. These tasks include
        decision-making, language understanding, pattern recognition,
        problem-solving, and more. At its core, AI involves the creation
        of algorithms that can learn from data, adapt over time, and
        make predictions or classifications. Modern AI has evolved to
        include subfields such as machine learning, natural language
        processing, computer vision, and robotics.</p>
